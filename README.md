# The-activator
This activator is legitimate because it does not provide you with the key.

This is useful because in case the default activator is damaged.

It's gonna activate with a legit server that help you to activate

But you need to provide the legit key so it's not totally free 

There is some site that you can buy cheaply Windows key for a couple of dollars.
